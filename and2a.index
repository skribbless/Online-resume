      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hello! I'm John Paulo Arellano Andal. You can call me Pau, not Pao.</p>

      <p>I was born and raised in the city of Batangas but later on continued my living in the City of Lucena, Province of Quezon</p>

      <p>I'm 21 years of age and taking the course of BSIT. It is now my second year in this course. Halfway through graduating.</p>

      <br>

      <br>

      <h3> Now moving on to my Working Experience</h3>

      <p>I worked on a small computer shop as a server manager for almost 8years. While at it i was a fulltime talisman player not considering it as a work but it pays me for my efforts as well.</p>

      <p>I also worked on a foodpark but not so long because of a toxic and unfair wroking environment.</p>

      <p>Now I am focusing on my studies while looking for a much more stable job that suits my schedule as a student.</p>
